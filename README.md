Machine Learning Project: Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease
Project Overview
This repository contains the project report and code for a machine learning-based approach to the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The project explores various machine learning models to classify and predict the progression of Alzheimer's Disease using longitudinal MRI data. The goal is to identify the most effective models for early detection, which can aid in timely intervention and treatment.

**Key Features:**

1.Dataset: Utilizes the OASIS Longitudinal MRI dataset, which includes 150 subjects aged 60 to 96, with 373 imaging sessions.

2.Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature scaling, handling missing values, and balancing the dataset using SMOTEENN.

3.Models Evaluated:

   Decision Tree

   Random Forest

   XGBoost

   Gradient Boosting

   Voting Classifier

   CatBoost

4.Performance Metrics: Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score with 15-fold cross-validation.

**Repository Structure**
